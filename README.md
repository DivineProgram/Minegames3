# Minegames3
#### Minegames 3 was a Minecraft world, programmed, developed and designed from scratch since March 2020.

# What is Minegames?
Minegames was initially a world where I could create minigames using the in-game coding system *command blocks*.
These minigames were intended for multiplayer and were built to be enjoyed by me and my friends.
After making considerable progress to the 3rd installment in the series, I then got the idea to publish it.
I did so, and now Minegames 3 exists as Minecraft map which entertains thousands of players worldwide.

There are a total of 12 minigames in the newest update. Each minigame was made to try and be unique; at this point in time, there's a large variety between the minigames. Some include PvP, others include parkour, some include building, and some require none of those at all. Minegames 3 is a world built to be enjoyed by everyone.

The world also includes a shop, where you can use points from winning minigames to get cosmetics. There is also an *info centre*, where there's information on the world, credits, a fully documented changelog, and settings.

***I can confirm Minegames 3 is still being occasionally updated***

## How do I start playing it?
Anyone who owns Minecraft Bedrock can download one of the files, open it in Minecraft if using a *.mcworld* file, or move it to the minecraftWorlds folder if using a *.zip* file, and then play on the world in-game. **The map is highly recommended to be played with at least two players.**

The map is made to be played on Minecraft Bedrock and will not work on Java, as it uses Bedrock's code syntax.

The inside of the world is easy to navigate in-game, with instructions and guidance being clear as I could make it. If you do need any assistance, though, visit the *Info Centre*, to the left of the world spawn point. Information, credits and settings can be found there.

## What about Minegames 1 and 2?
Minegames 1 and 2 were lost due to errors with sorting out my storage; these worlds had no backup.
I have had thoughts to remaster these maps. However, I haven't gotten around to this.

# Version Compatibility

### Version 3.11.2 was intended for Minecraft Bedrock v1.18.31 and above
### Version 3.12.1 was intended for Minecraft Bedrock v1.19.20 and above

# Development
I've estimated that around **1500 command blocks** have been placed inside the world, each holding a single line of code. Some of the lines of code are extremely long, to condense all the code into a single line, whereas others are simpler.

The command blocks can be visited by any player, by finding the "secret" entrance under the spawn island. Here, there's a category of teleports which will take you to the different areas of which different processes are coded. There is a specific area for each minigame and for other significant features (such as the shop). To access the command blocks (and their code), a player must have *operator* permissions on the world, and be in creative mode.

The maps and play-areas for the minigames are also built from scratch, serving almost as a form of game design. The structure of the minigame's map could entirely alter the minigames' gameplay, experience, and overall feel. Being both a player of the world and the developer of it, I've been effective in making a world that feels fluid and making an experience that brings maximum enjoyment, besides occasional bugs which I may sometimes fail to recognise. Bug's are usually fixed as soon as they are found.

**The world is even designed to be playable by colorblind users.** Most minigames that relies on the interpretation of colour have been designed so that a colorblind player can still navigate and play the minigame to no disadvantage. The one and only exception to this is in Build Temple, a minigame about accurately replicating a build you are presented with. Sometimes the build the player is presented with includes an assortment of coloured blocks, of which I could find no effective or efficient way of communicating to the player the name of the colour.

The world has been developed since its creation on the **22nd March 2020**. The lastest update was released on the 21st August 2022. Updates tend to include quality of life changes, added or improved minigame maps and play-areas, and of course new minigames.

Although only 12 minigames exist in the world, technically a total of 17 have actually been developed for Minegames 3. Three of those were lost due to personal imcompetance and two were rebuilt when they were remastered, often due to their original version being sub-par compared to other minigames. That means a total of 5 minigames were developed by never used.
